- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature").
- Keep the subject line short and descriptive (under 72 characters).
- Use the body to explain *what* and *why* vs. *how* if more detail is needed.

### Code Style

- This project uses ESLint for code consistency. Please ensure `npm run lint` passes before submitting a PR.
- Follow TypeScript best practices.
- Keep components focused and reusable.
